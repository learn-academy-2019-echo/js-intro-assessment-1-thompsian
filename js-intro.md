# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A compartmentalized segment of code that can be called from elsewhere. Can pass variables, arguments into the function and return information as output.

  Researched answer: Block of code designed to perform a particular task. Executed only when called. Function parameters are listed within the parenthesis. Function arguments are the values that the function recieves when called. The function stops processing after the return statement, the return value is returned to the "caller"



2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: length , shift , unshift , indexOf, concat

  Researched answer: Many possible examples. 5 mutators which change the original array are push, pop,shift,unshift,reverse. 4 accessors which do not change the original array values are concat, join, indexOf, lastIndexOf.



3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: return is used to return a value from a function. There can only be one per function and code after the return line does not run. console.log() can be used anywhere and with multiple instances, not nessacarily within a function. console.log() is most useful for debugging purposes.

  Researched answer: Console.log is used for debuging purposes. Return sends a value from the function back to the "caller". A function will stop computing once it reaches a return statement, continues on past console.log statements.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: An argument is a piece of information to be passed to the function from outside of the function, it may contain variables. A variable can be declared inside or outside of a function and can be used as an argument. Different datatypes can be used and the content of the variable can be changed.

  Researched answer: Arguments are passed to the function by value. If the function changes the value it does not change the original parameters value. If a function changes a variables value, the original parameter is also changed.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer: Driver and Navigator. Driver types and decides the details , Navigator focuses on the higher level and assists the driver.

  Researched answer: Agile software development technique. Driver types the code , navigator reviews the code. Navigator also thinks about the strategic direction of the work, improvement ideas, and likely future problems to solve.



6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: Scripting language that allows web applications to perform actions and be dynamic rather than just displaying static information.


7. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: This assessment. Feeling that I understand concepts while within the pair programming environment is one thing. Being able to solve problems individually is another. This assignment helped me find some holes in my understanding and a few things just "clicked".
